			     History of the Android Mascot
			 </h1>

			 <p>
			     You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices in the world. But maybe you don't know that your friendly mascot has a name and a very curious story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.
			 </p>

			 <h2>
			    The first version
			 </h2>

			 <p>
			    The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a class="externa" href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that he opened <a class="externa" href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>(free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to personify the system for his team; there was no request from the company to create a mascot.

			 <p>
			    This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: they would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.
			 </p>

			 <h2>
			     A new mascot emerges
			 </h2>

			 <p>
			     The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a class="externa" href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank">Irina Blok</a> also a Google employee, was given the mission of representing the little robot in a more pleasant way.

			<p>
			     Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few lines and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with whoever looks at it. That's how <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android new mascot, was born.
			 </p>
			 
			 <img src="C:\Users\pessoa 1\OneDrive\Documentos\curso-gustavo-guanabara\android-exercise\imagens\bugdroid.png" class="pequena"alt="Bugdroid">

			 <p>
			     The main inspiration for the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> lines came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the type of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> office and looked at the side of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.
